# Custom Token Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that enables the creation of a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows token transfers, burning of tokens, and token minting by the contract owner.

## Contract Details

- The contract creates a custom token with a specified name, symbol, and total supply.
- It keeps track of token balances for each address using a mapping.
- The contract emits events for token transfers, token burns, and token minting.
- The contract owner has special privileges to mint new tokens.
- The contract owner can transfer ownership to another address if needed.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a development environment set up for Ethereum smart contract development, including Solidity and a development framework like Hardhat.
- Install the necessary dependencies and tools such as Remix for interacting with the smart contract.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

2. Open the contract file (`MyToken.sol`) in your preferred Solidity code editor.

3. Customize the token properties and initial supply values according to your requirements.

4. Compile the contract using your development framework (e.g., Hardhat) to generate the contract's bytecode and ABI.

5. Deploy the contract to your local development network or the Ethereum testnet/mainnet using a tool like Remix or a deployment script.

6. Interact with the deployed contract using the provided functions:

   - Use the `transfer` function to transfer tokens from one address to another.
   - Use the `burn` function to permanently remove tokens from an address.
   - If you are the contract owner, use the `mint` function to create new tokens.

## Testing

- You can write tests for the contract using a testing framework like Hardhat's built-in testing functionality or other frameworks like Truffle.
- Ensure that you test various scenarios, such as transfers, burns, and minting, to verify the contract's behavior.

## Security Considerations

- When deploying the contract to the Ethereum mainnet, exercise caution and thoroughly test the contract on a local or test network to identify and address any potential security vulnerabilities.
- Follow best practices for smart contract development, such as using safe math libraries and conducting extensive testing.
